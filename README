Scanning
======== 
You will need a go compiler, Which you could download at https://go.dev or via respective package manager (if you're on Linux/BSD/*nix)

Start by compiling first:
  $ cd src/
  $ go build -o ../scanner .

or if you're on windows:
  > cd src/
  > go build -o ..\scanner.exe .

Then run the scanner program on the same directory where denstv_hosts.txt is placed
  $ ./scanner -checkstream

or if you're on windows:
  > .\scanner.exe -checkstream

output will be saved to denstv.m3u8, which could be loaded with an IPTV client.
